This program compares the outputs of your computer science project to that of a project that (we think) works

How to run:
  Download the contents of this repo as a .zip and unpack to a folder of your choice
  Paste your project into the "compsci_project" file
  Open command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved this program
  Run the program using the command "Python tester.py"

  How to use the program:
    While running, the program will cycle through the testcases of handin 2 automatically.
    It will stop when there is a difference in output between your program and the "expected output"
    You can enter:
    - "t" to view the test case on which your program deviated from the expected output
    - "o" to view the expected output again
    - "r" to run your program again (This allows changes you make to be reflected in this script without having to restart it, so long as you edit the "compsci_project" file and remember to save)
    - nothing to continue with the program


Please note:
This program was made by a dumbass who doesn't even take compsci. The expected outputs are the results of his roomate's program (Thanks Christiaan).
I accept no responsibily for any effects that result from this program.
